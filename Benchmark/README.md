# Benchmark results

This is a collection of scripts for running the benchmarks described in our publication.

_________________

## In order to replicate the benchmark results, it is necessary to install RDKit.

```
conda install -c rdkit rdkit
```

## The slight distortions (shearing, rotation) are applied to the benchmark images by running:

```
python distort_images.py $input_directory $output_directory
```

## Run DECIMER and save the results in a file:
```
python run_decimer_save_results.py $image_dir $benchmark_ID
```

- The results of the benchmark run are going to be save in $benchmark_ID.txt which contains the image names and the results (SMILES representation of the depicted molecule)
- Per line: $image_name \t $SMILES

## Evaluate the benchmark results:
```
python evaluate_benchmarks.py $benchmark_ID.txt $reference_file_directory
```
- $benchmark_ID.txt is the output generated by run_decimer_save_results.py
- $reference_file_directory is the path of a directory that contains SD- or mol-files as provided in the benchmark datasets
