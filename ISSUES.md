## DECIMER Image Transformer GitHub issues policy

If you open a GitHub Issue on DECIMER-Image Transformer, here is our policy:

1. It must be a bug/performance issue, dataset-related questions, a build issue or a documentation issue (for small doc fixes please send a PR instead).

2. Many of your inquiries can be resolved by referring to our most recent paper, which would save time for both you and us. Please feel free to contact us via email if your questions are not addressed within the paper.

3. Make sure the Issue Template is filled out.

4. The issue should be related to the repository it is created in.

**Here's why we have this policy:** Our primary focus is on tasks that benefit the entire community, such as resolving bugs and implementing new features. While we strive to provide individual support, it may take some time for us to address specific issues. In such situations, we highly recommend that you first attempt to find solutions through platforms like Stack Overflow or other non-GitHub channels. It is crucial to thoroughly complete the GitHub template to ensure all the necessary details for recreating the issue are properly addressed. This approach allows us to handle bug reports and feature requests promptly and efficiently.
